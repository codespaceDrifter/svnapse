# torchrvn

pytorch implementation of frontier ml algorithms.also includes tokenizers, training, inference, eval scripts, datasets. includes some basic ML specific notes in articles tho most ML theory notes are in the MINDMECH repo. includes specific models trained with these algorithms and datasets. this is NOT meant to be a pip package the code is supposed to be copied and maybe modified in different important model trainings to make it more direct.
