1d data plots (one column):  
note that by discrete here i dont just mean qualitative discrete i mean categorical too  


bar graph (discrete): x axis: discrete / types. y axis: count  
histogram (continuous): x axis: ranges of continuous. y axis: count   

2 d data plots (two column):  
bar graph(discrete, discrete): x axis: discrete / type. color: discrete / type. y axis: count  
box plot(discrete, continuous): x axis: discrete / type. y axis: median, Q1, Q3, min, max of a continuous value  
scatter plot(continuous, continuous): x axis: continuous. y axis: continuous. each point is a row on the two columns  

3d data plots (three column):  
scatter matrix(continuous, continuous, continuous): 9 graphs for 3 continuous values.

colored scatter plot(discrete, continuous, continuous): x axis: continuous value 1. y axis: continuous value 2. color: value 3.
