Data is divided into Qualitative and Qualitative.
Qualitiative data are a description. i.e. color, species
Qualitative are a numerical value. i.e. velocity, money

Qualitative: divided into nominal (type) vs ordinal (ranking)
i.e. Nominal: blood type, car brands. 
i.e. Ordinal: income brackets, education level.

Quantative: divided into discrete (int) vs continuous (float)

encodings:
one hot encoding for nominal: 
i.e. Red Green Blue -> three seperate columns. if red, then red column = 1, other 2 = 0. etc. 
ordered encoding for ordinal
i.e. education level highschool, undergrad, grad -> 0, 1, 2

fill in empty/error cells
0 fill in 
mean fill in: if it's numerical continuous
mode fill in: if most are one type. i.e. most users are bronze level. just fill in bronze.
